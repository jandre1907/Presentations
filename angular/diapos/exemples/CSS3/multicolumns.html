Apache CouchDB is one of a new breed of database management systems. This chapter
explains why there’s a need for new systems as well as the motivations behind building
CouchDB.
As CouchDB developers, we’re naturally very excited to be using CouchDB. In this
chapter we’ll share with you the reasons for our enthusiasm. We’ll show you how
CouchDB’s schema-free document model is a better fit for common applications,
how the built-in query engine is a powerful way to use and process your data, and how
CouchDB’s design lends itself to modularization and scalability.
Relax
If there’s one word to describe CouchDB, it is relax. It is in the title of this book, it is
the byline to CouchDB’s official logo, and when you start CouchDB, you see:
Apache CouchDB has started. Time to relax.
Why is relaxation important? Developer productivity roughly doubled in the last five
years. The chief reason for the boost is more powerful tools that are easier to use. Take
Ruby on Rails as an example. It is an infinitely complex framework, but it’s easy to get
started with. Rails is a success story because of the core design focus on ease of use.
This is one reason why CouchDB is relaxing: learning CouchDB and understanding its
core concepts should feel natural to most everybody who has been doing any work on
the Web. And it is still pretty easy to explain to non-technical people.
Getting out of the way when creative people try to build specialized solutions is in itself
a core feature and one thing that CouchDB aims to get right. We found existing tools
too cumbersome to work with during development or in production, and decided to
focus on making CouchDB easy, even a pleasure, to use. Chapters 3 and 4 will dem-
onstrate the intuitive HTTP-based REST API.
Another area of relaxation for CouchDB users is the production setting. If you have a
live running application, CouchDB again goes out of its way to avoid troubling you.

Its internal architecture is fault-tolerant, and failures occur in a controlled environment
and are dealt with gracefully. Single problems do not cascade through an entire server
system but stay isolated in single requests.
CouchDB’s core concepts are simple (yet powerful) and well understood. Operations
teams (if you have a team; otherwise, that’s you) do not have to fear random behavior
and untraceable errors. If anything should go wrong, you can easily find out what the
problem is—but these situations are rare.
CouchDB is also designed to handle varying traffic gracefully. For instance, if a website
is experiencing a sudden spike in traffic, CouchDB will generally absorb a lot of con-
current requests without falling over. It may take a little more time for each request,
but they all get answered. When the spike is over, CouchDB will work with regular
speed again.
The third area of relaxation is growing and shrinking the underlying hardware of your
application. This is commonly referred to as scaling. CouchDB enforces a set of limits
on the programmer. On first look, CouchDB might seem inflexible, but some features
are left out by design for the simple reason that if CouchDB supported them, it would
allow a programmer to create applications that couldn’t deal with scaling up or down.
We’ll explore the whole matter of scaling CouchDB in Part IV, Deploying CouchDB.
In a nutshell: CouchDB doesn’t let you do things that would get you in trouble later
on. This sometimes means you’ll have to unlearn best practices you might have picked
up in your current or past work. Chapter 24 contains a list of common tasks and how
to solve them in CouchDB.
